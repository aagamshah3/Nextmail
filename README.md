Next Generation E-mail Application

The objective of this project is to write an e-mail open web application that treats e-mails not only as a list of messages but also as a list of things to do.

Whenever the user opens the application, they can choose between seeing:
1. The Todo List;
2. The Inbox

Choosing 1. shows a list of messages already read, sorted by deadline before action must be taken.

Choosing 2. shows the unread and read messages as in a Inbox of a Mail Client.
