Next Generation E-mail Application

The objective of this project is to write an e-mail open web application that threats e-mails not as a list of messages but as a list of things to do.

Whenever the user opens the application, they can choose between seeing:
1. the todo list (i.e. messages already read);
2. the new items, one by one (i.e. messages not read yet).

Choosing 1. shows a list of messages already read, sorted by deadline before action must be taken.

Choosing 2. shows the unread messages, one by one. There is no list. All messages are ready by order of arrival.
