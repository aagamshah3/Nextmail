Next Generation E-mail Application

The objective of this project is to write an e-mail open web application that treats e-mails not only as a list of messages but also as a list of things to do.

Whenever the user opens the application, they can choose between seeing:

1. The Todo List;
2. The Inbox

Choosing 1. shows a list of messages already read, sorted by deadline before action must be taken.

Choosing 2. shows the unread and read messages as in the Inbox of an E-mail Client.

Features:
---------
1. Responsive Design
2. Read All Messages
3. Unread Messages Highlighted
4. Compose, Reply, Delete and Forward Messages
5. Tag a Message as Today, Tomorrow or In A Week and add to the To Do List
6. Mark Messages as Done and Remove the Tag
7. Currently Supports Gmail and Yahoo
